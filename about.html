		<h2> About Me</h2>
		<img src='assets/images/me.jpg' alt='John Reda' height= 250px width= 200px>
			<p> My name is John Reda and I'm beginning my career as a web developer. I earned my BFA with a concentration in Photography from Rutgers University in 2014. While still in school, I started working for Apple at their Bridgewater Commons location. I began my career at Apple as a part-time sales specialist. Upon graduating, I moved into a full time role as a mobile certified technician. After spending 6 months in that role, I became an Apple Certfied Mac Technician, which is where I am today.
			<br>
			<br>
			My hobbies include photography and music, and one of my favorite things to do is visit New York City and explore all of the different neighborhoods.
