		<h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
		<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="John Reda" height=250px, width=200px>
		<p>My name is John Reda and I am a Web Developer. This paragraph will become my "about me" page when I can finally figure out what I want to say about myself. For now though, I'm going to put a lot of fluff and filler in here just so that I can see what I'm doing and what this page is going to look like.

		I graduated from Rutgers University's Mason Gross School of the Arts in 2014 with a BFA in Photography. While at school, I began to work for Apple at their Bridgewater Commons location. I began my career at Apple as a part time Sales Specialist, before moving into a full time position as a mobile device techinician. After 6 months in that role, I transitioned into my role as a Mac Certified Techinician, which is where I'm at today. I'm learning web development to help me continue to develop my career.</p>
